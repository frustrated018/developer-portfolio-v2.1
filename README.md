# Dev Portfolio V2

This is my second developer portfolio. My first dev portfolio was built using Next.js, GASP, and Lenis. It was my first time using any of these technologies. While the journey of learning was arduous, it was fun nonetheless. A lot of lessons have been learned, and I want to build on top of that. Also, I want to use this new library called Aceternity UI to start this project.
